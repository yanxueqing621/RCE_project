## Background

RNA Codon Expansion (RCE) strategy that introduces and decodes bioorthogonally assignable ΨCodons (ΨGA, ΨAA or ΨAG) at specified mRNA transcripts for ncAA incorporation in mammalian cells. This project provided the customized code for assessing sudoU off-target of RCE tools (RNA Codon Expansion)



## System Requirement



### Hardware requirements
This pipeline requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to support the in-memory operations.

### Software requirements
- Linux: Rocky Linux 8.8

### Software 
- PRAISE pipeline (version 1.0)
- Methylsig R package (version 1.17.0)
- 



## Example and Usage
### 一. call transcriptomic-wide Ψ site from PRAISE sequecing method
After obtained raw data of the PRAISE sequencing, we firstly need to call transcriptomic-wide Ψ sites by published PRAISE-pipeline (https://github.com/Zhe-jiang/PRAISE). The outputfile
